# MRI_data_preparation
The python program uses numpy and nibabel libraries and reads magnetic resonance images from a directory and returns 
two dimensional and one dimensional numpy arrays for further processing of MRI data.

Data can also be normalized by calling normalized function. This function will normalize the data between 0-1.
